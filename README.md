A game where you fall down and avoid obstacles

This is an old and outdated but fun little experiment with HTML5 canvas.
I created this back in 2015, deleted it by accident and now had to rescue it from the web archive :/
Unfortunately, the graphics, music and sound effects couldn't be rescued, so I replaced them with placeholders

Nevertheless this little experiment demonstrates pretty well what can be done with HTML5 canvas elements, so I wanted to share it.
